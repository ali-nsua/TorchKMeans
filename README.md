# TorchKMeans
A torch-based implementation of K-Means and K-Means++

## Notes
Please note that this repository is still in WIP phase, but feel free to jump in.

The goal is to reach the fastest and cleanest implementation of K-Means, K-Means++ and Mini-Batch K-Means using PyTorch only, so that we can benefit all the CUDA greatness.
