# TorchKMeans
A torch-based implementation of K-Means and K-Means++

## Notes
Please note that this repository is still in WIP phase, but feel free to jump in.

The goal is to reach the fastest and cleanest implementation of K-Means, K-Means++ and Mini-Batch K-Means using PyTorch only, so that we can benefit all the CUDA greatness.


Here's the progress so far:

:white_check_mark: K-Means

:white_check_mark: Similarity-based K-Means (Spherical K-Means)

:white_check_mark: Custom metrics for K-Means

:white_check_mark: K-Means++ initialization

:white_check_mark: DISCERN initialization

:white_check_mark: Purity score

:black_square_button: (Testing) MiniBatch K-Means

:black_square_button: MiniBatch K-Means optimized by torch.optim

:black_square_button: MiniBatch K-Means++ initialization
